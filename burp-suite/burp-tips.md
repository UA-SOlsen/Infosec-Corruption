# Burp tips

*  search `"<!"` For comments in script and redirects
* Proxy options - disable clientside  validation input and I hide hidden form fields
* Sitemap: unhide 401/402/403/404's, they may be useful to fuzz.
* Proxy // search and replace : change `"^x-xss-protection.* 0"` to  `^x-xss-protection. *$`
* change `"^content-security-policy"` replace to nothing
* search  `"Notice: unidentified index"` in burp and/or use Arjun, Aron, Parameth on any php endpoint for XSS for undiscovered parameters
* Testing opaque data:
  * if access is handled via a url parameter, rather than a cookie, Authorization header or token and that parameter appears to be hex-encoded:

    * use payload type : `character frobber`

    If the value looks like unverified encrypted data \(XOR or ECB\):

    *  find what part of the string impacts the response
    * use payload type: `bit flipper`
* In intruder tab, options, look for section "**GREP**"

  clear the current presets and load  `regex/errors.txt` from fuzz-db files.  This will search all output pages generated by intruder payloads for a long list of error strings.

* disable client-side input validation when testing with browser
* testing a thickclient? set your proxy to support invisible mode
* use burp's match and replace to flip "False" with "True" in responses \(or "user" to "admin", or "none" to "all" or whatever else you can think of\)
* Add to scope all your target subdomains on[ Burp\_Suite](https://twitter.com/Burp_Suite) “Target” tab 
  *  “Scope” &gt;&gt; "advanced scope control”
  * Set Protocol: `Any —`  Host/IP range: `^*\.domain\.com/*$` 
* To find open redirect vulnerabilities \(and maybe SSRF\), search "`=http"`or “`=aHR0`”（base64 encode "http"） in “Request header” and status code 30X 
* To manually assign a certain amount of memory \(i.e. 2GB\) to Burp, open the program from the command line with : `java -jar -Xmx2G <BurpSuite.jar>`
* \`\`
